# RegentScores

A web-app built for my high-school to post students regent online where parents/students can view them right away.

Default admin user credentials  
Username: ``username``  
Password: ``password``  
* change this in ``regentScore.sql`` under ``INSERT INTO 'users'``  

## What I Exercised/Learned

* Create and interact with a mySQL database
* Developed an API to communicate between the front-end and back-end
* Authenticate users and then only have limited-access for the system... Admin -> admin access; Parent/Student -> student access
* User status, the ability for school to prevent student from seeing their score temporarily
