# PROJECT IN PROGRESS

# RegentScores

A web-app built for my high-school to post students regent scores online where parents/students can view them right away.

Default admin user credentials  
Username: ``username``  
Password: ``password``  
* change this in ``regentScore.sql`` under ``INSERT INTO 'users'``  

## What I Exercised/Learned

* Create and interact with a mySQL database
* Developed an API to communicate between the front-end and back-end
* Authenticate users and then give them access based on their user privileges, i.e. Admin and Basic
* User status: the ability for a school to prevent a student(s) from temporarily seeing their scores
